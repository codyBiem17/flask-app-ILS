Step 2: Monitor the Build
You can monitor the progress of your build in the Build details section.
When the build is complete, you can check the logs to ensure the process ran correctly.

If everything went well, AWS CodeBuild should now have successfully built your Flask app.
You can deploy the app using AWS services like AWS Elastic Beanstalk or AWS EC2.
